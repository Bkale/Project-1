PING PONG game.


Technology used:
.Javascript
.HTML
.CSS

HOW IT WORKS:

The game focuses one running my game loop function in intervals while incrementing the ball positions to simulate a moving mall. I created a movement function to handle the movement of the paddles for both players and a game over function to detect when the game ends.

PROBLEMS:
.When a player scores,I have trouble stopping the game and waiting for the players to start the next round.

.When one player holds down his keys, the other player cannot move.


CONTROLS:
.player 1 controls are the (A for up, Z for Down)
.player 2 controls are the (up key to go up and the down key to do down)
